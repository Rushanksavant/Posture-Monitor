    <h1>Problem</h1>
    <p>In day to day busy life, its difficult for us to constatntly take care of our body posture</p>
    <p>Focusing on problems due to this;</p>
    <p>Poor posture can cause back, neck, and shoulder pain. Poor posture causes you to slouch, leading to tension and pain in your upper back and shoulders. However, you also don't want to “overcorrect” your posture by pulling your shoulders back too far as this could cause muscle tension, leading to stiffness</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Sloution Proposed</h2>
    <p> -Flex Sensor can be used to measure the bend or slouching of back</p>
    <p> -This can be done by making a "Support X-Vest" which has a flex sensor attached at its back</p>
    <p> -Reading from the sensor were sensed by an ECU, and further sent to firebase</p>
    <p> -An "if condition" existed for some threshold values of sensor in the R-pi, which if noticed for a particular period of time, an email was sent to the user to improve his/her posture</p>
